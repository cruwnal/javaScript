let fruits = ["apple","mango","banana"];
console.log(fruits);
console.log(typeof fruits);//result will be objects 
// how we can know that fruits is an array so there is on method or function in java script Array.isArray();
console.log(Array.isArray(fruits));//i will check that the fruits is array or not and aswer will be in true and false 

let obj = {}; //we called object literal
console.log(Array.isArray(obj));
